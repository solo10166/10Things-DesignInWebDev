    <h1>Why Design is Important in Web Dev</h1>
    <p>As is with any medium of production, design and aesthetic is essential in the conceptualizing, marketing, distribution, and usability of a website. Being a filmmaker, I made a quick, strong connection to the idea that every little element of a website, similar to that of the elements of a film, must be thoroughly thought out, designed, and placed in a specific order and space to make the greatest, or smallest, impact. The five principles of visual design (scale, hierarchy, balance, contrast, and the gestalt principles) truly do turn a simple bit of code, or film, into a workable product. 
    </p>
    <p>On a website, scale is everything - if the logo is too centered or the main content just a tiny bit displaced from where the viewer naturally looks, the consumer will get a feeling of discomfort from it. It may not even consciously affect the viewer, but subconsciously they will avoid the site due to its layout. Similarly, if the hierarchy of the content is not logical and placed as so, it will make the site harder to use. This dives a bit into the realm of design principles, but it is important that, when building a site or really any published work, the most used information (home buttons, menu buttons, etc.) be placed at the top for easy accessibility, followed by the leading information for the time (sales and deals, most recent news, newest blog, etc.), and finally the least important information (ads, old articles, fun articles, basic shopping) is listed and placed last. 
    </p>
    <p>With both of these, in more of the design and art aspect, the color, contrast, and dominance of specific items can completely set the focus of the page and the tone of the site as a whole. For instance, on Amazon’s home page, the sales, seasonal deals, etc. all have a cool and colorful background design or image while the “Buy Again” items are displayed in a straight line with a white background. Other sites often have specific titles, items, recent news, etc. all accented via a color or a design to show that it is important. Even in TV and film this is a concept used - breaking news is always displayed in a red, bold, arial font on a black or white background so that it contrasts to catch the eyes of viewers. In a film, important objects and people are highlighted and accented using lights and colors. This is the same for websites - designing important information to be accented and highlighted draws the viewer’s attention. It helps certain elements dominate the page (Google’s colorful title in the middle of the page draws all of the attention to the title, while the search bar blends in with the background). Overall, color, contrast, and highlighting can emphasize exactly what the developer wants the audience to see. This also works with the gestalt principle of seeing something (the site) as a whole. In film, there is a phrase that we all live by - good editors should never be noticed. This means that if an editor did their job well, nobody should know it because the film flows so smoothly and is edited to look natural. This applies directly to web design as well - if a website is designed well, the average viewer shouldn’t think of the designer or the design - it should feel natural and nearly perfect in use and look. Because viewers tend to look at a site in its entirety rather than individual details, they should not even think about the fact that a designer spent time creating each individual detail of the page. It should seem seamless.
    </p>
    <p>	Overall, the design of a web page is more important than the coding itself because, if done right, the layout, scaling, color, sizing, highlighting and contrast, and more can direct a user and draw their eye without saying anything. The design of the site can control a user and, when done right, can make or break the site. </p>
